## Programming languages

{{< language_logos >}}

* JavaScript 
* TypeScript
* Swift

I've used javascript for most of my projects until now. I've also began learning Swift, because I wanted to try developing apps using SwiftUI. Swift's types made me kind of addicted to intellisense, and I wanted to try TypeScript, which I immediately loved for its types and interfaces.

## Libraries/frameworks

{{< libraries_logos >}}

* React
  * Next.js
  * CRA
  * Expo/React Native
* Vue
* SwiftUI

## IDEs

* Visual Studio Code
* XCode

I use VSCode for basically all programming I do, except for when I'm working with Swift. Then I use Xcode.
  
## Languages

* Dutch (native)
* English (secondary, fluent)
* German (mostly listening as of now)

I was born in The Netherlands, so I speak Dutch natively. And I've learned a lot of English by speaking/interacting online, I'm basically fluent in English now. I learned German mostly through listening to my family speak with Limburgish dialect and by learning it at school. I'm not quite fluent in German though :).
